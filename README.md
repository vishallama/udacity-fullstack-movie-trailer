## Quickstart

Download the project folder by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button on the right side of this page, or you can download it directly by clicking [here](https://github.com/vishallama/udacity-fullstack-movie-trailer/archive/master.zip "Movie Trailer Website").

Unzip the downloaded file. Then, `cd` into the folder using a terminal program or emulator.

Run command `python fresh_tomatoes.py` from inside the project folder. It should generate an **index.html** file, which should automatically open in your default browser in a new tab or window. Note this assumes you have `python` version **2.7.x** installed on your system.

Running command `python3 fresh_tomatoes.py` should also work.

## Software Requirements

At the very least, you should have **Python** version 2.7.x installed on your system. The code should also work with Python version 3.x, but this is not guaranteed.
